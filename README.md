# DLSS-Image-Super-Sampling
Here, We have developed and deployed Generative Adversial Networks with help of tensorflow, Keras and Django to convert the low resolution images to High resolution images.
We used a dataset of pokemon character images of size 64*64 and converted them to get the images of high resolution with dimensions 128*128.
